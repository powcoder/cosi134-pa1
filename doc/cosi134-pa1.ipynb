    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`Logistic Regression` (aka `Maximum Entropy`) has been one of the workhorses in natural language processing. It has also been used very widely in other fields. The model has many strengths. It is effective when you have a large number of features as it handles the correlation between features well. In addition, the time and space complexity for the model is not too taxing. All of these reasons make the Logistic Regression model a very versatile classifier for many NLP tasks. It is also a good starting point to understand more complicated neural network methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are going to use the Logistic Regression model on 2 different text classification tasks. One for name classification, and another for discourse relation classification. The name classification is a toy problem that you can use to test and debug your code."
